Samouraï
--------

This spicy sauce is Swish in-origin but has become very popular in France.
It is most commonly used as a sauce for fries, but I often use it as a condiment for a variety of dishes, primarily sandwiches.

#. 5 Tbsp Mayonaise
#. 3 Tbsp `Harissa (Hot) <http://www.minaharissa.com/index.php?/products>`_
#. 1 Tbsp Ketchup (preferably spicy)
